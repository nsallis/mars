My Auto-Rice Script - an auto-rice script for minimal-ubuntu

## Getting Started
Run the setup script with
```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsallis/mars/master/installer.sh)
```

## Background
this script takes you from a basic minimal-ubuntu install to a fully set up i3 instance with neovim, chrome, and a bunch of
lightweight goodies.
